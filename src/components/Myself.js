      <p className="aboutInfo">Hello, my name is Joseph Burns. I used to never collect pins. However, that all 
        changed when I attended a pin collecting panel at a convention with some friends.
        Seeing the network of people trading, selling, and conversing made me smile. It
        was a community that had a passion of collecting pins. Now, I have begun my journey
        collecting pins and making friends along the way.
